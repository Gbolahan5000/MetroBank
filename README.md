# Metro Bank Customer and Performance Analysis Documentation
This repository contains the analysis of Metro Bank's customer base, financial relationships, transaction behavior, and branch performance, culminating in an initial risk assessment. The project was executed over five weeks, with each week focusing on a distinct area of analysis.
## Week 1: Customer Profile and Segmentation
The first week focused on understanding **Who is the Metro Bank Customer?** by examining demographics, tenure, income, and key segmentation metrics.
- **Total Customers: 500**
- **Average Income: $114,398.82**
- **Gender Distribution:** The customer base is nearly balanced, with **51% Female** and **49% Male**.
- **Regional Distribution:** Customers are distributed across four regions
  - South: 137 customers
  - East: 133 customers
  - North: 120 customers
  - West: 110 customers
- **Key Segments (Scale vs. Value):** The customer base is heavily skewed towards **Retail (286 customers)**, followed by Corporate (169) and Private (45).
- **Tenure:** The largest group of customers is **Established (3-5 Yrs)**, totaling 170 customers.
## Week 2: Accounts & Financial Relationships
This phase mapped the overall financial health and customer relationships by analyzing product ownership, total balances, and credit profiles.
- **Total Deposit Balance: $212,341,134.00**
- **Total Approved Loan: $3,677,399.00**
- **Average Credit Score:** The overall credit profile is **580**
- **Product Ownership:**
  - There are four unique products: checking, credit card, loan, and saving.
  - **195 individuals** utilize more than one product.
  - Savings accounts are the most common (235), followed by Checking (190), Credit Card (143), and Loan (81).
- **Balance Insights: Private customers** lead with a higher average per customer balance, but **Retail** holds a higher total deposit due to their sheer number.
- **Millennials and Gen Zs** hold higher balances than older generations
- **High-Value Customers:** The top five individual customers each maintain balances exceeding **$1.7 million**.
- **Occupations** with the largest deposit balances are **bankers, doctors, and engineers.**
## Week 3: Transaction Behavior & Patterns
The third week analyzed transactional data to identify customer engagement and usage preferences, leading to key recommendations.
### Transaction Overview
- **Total Transactions: 5,000 individual transactions.**
- **Total Value: $25,066,089.00**
- **Average Value: $5,013.22**
- **Problem:** The high average value suggests Metro Bank may be missing out on low-value, high-frequency transactions that typically deepen customer engagement.
- **Recommendation:** Expand services for smaller everyday payments (e.g., microtransactions, digital wallets).
### Transaction Type and Channel Preference
- **Transaction Type: Withdrawals** ($6.39M) slightly **exceed deposits** ($6.20M), posing a risk of net outflow.
  - **Recommendation:** Incentivize deposits (e.g., higher savings rate) and promote active transactions like bill payments and transfers.
- **Channel Preference: ATM ($6.31M) and Branch ($6.31M)** transactions are high, leading to high maintenance costs.
  - **Recommendation:** Encourage migration to online ($6.08M) and mobile channels.
### Merchant and Credit Card Analysis
- **Merchant Activity:** Spending is concentrated in digital services and travel **(Airbnb, Apple)**, with **Local Retail** lagging behind.
  - **Recommendation:** Expand merchant partnerships with local shops and offer loyalty rewards.
- **Credit Card Usage:** Customers without credit cards are making more payment-type transactions.
  - **Problem:** This indicates credit cards aren't positioned as the preferred payment tool.
  - **Recommendation:** Reposition credit cards as the primary payment tool (e.g., cashback on bills) and target non-card customers.
## Week 4: Branch Performance & Efficiency
This section evaluated the financial and operational efficiency of Metro Bank's four regional branches.
### Overall Financials
- **Total Revenue: $59.42M**
- **Total Cost: $21.17M**
- **Total Profit: $38.25M**
- **Profit Margin: 64%**
- **Average Revenue per Staff: $30.46K**
### Key Branch Recommendations
- **Invest in North & West:** These regions show the highest efficiency and margins. West has the highest Revenue per Staff.
- **Optimize South:** Strongest revenue, but operating costs are significantly high.
- **Reassess East:** The weakest financial performer, requiring restructuring or support.
## Week 5: Risk Analysis and Mitigation
The final week focused on identifying and classifying risk patterns through the lens of customer complaints and fraud cases.
- **Total Complaints: 800**
- **Total Fraud Cases: 142**
- **Average Resolution Days: 31 days**
### Key Risk Insights
- **Most At-Risk Segment: The Retail segment (58.00%)** customers are most at risk and report the majority of issues, exceeding Corporate and Private combined.
- **Case Status: 59%** of reported cases have already been resolved.
- **Complaint Types:** The most frequent types of complaints are Charges Dispute (184), Others (167), Service Delay (159), Technical Issues (148), and Fraud (142).
### Risk Recommendations
- **Strengthen Risk Profiling:** Enhance real-time monitoring to catch behavioral red flags earlier.
- **Encourage Financial Literacy:** Use personalized messaging to increase engagement for medium-risk customers.
- **Introduce Credit Support:** Implement credit support or restructuring programs for high-risk customers to minimize potential defaults.
