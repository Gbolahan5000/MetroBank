  - Savings accounts are the most common (235), followed by Checking (190), Credit Card (143), and Loan (81).

## Week 3: Transaction Behavior & Patterns
The third week analyzed transactional data to identify customer engagement and usage preferences, leading to key recommendations.
### Transaction Overview
- **Total Transactions: 5,000 individual transactions.**
- **Total Value: $25,066,089.00**
- **Average Value: $5,013.22**
- **Problem:** The high average value suggests Metro Bank may be missing out on low-value, high-frequency transactions that typically deepen customer engagement.
- **Recommendation:** Expand services for smaller everyday payments (e.g., microtransactions, digital wallets).
### Transaction Type and Channel Preference
- **Transaction Type: Withdrawals** ($6.39M) slightly **exceed deposits** ($6.20M), posing a risk of net outflow.
  - **Recommendation:** Incentivize deposits (e.g., higher savings rate) and promote active transactions like bill payments and transfers.
- **Channel Preference: ATM ($6.31M) and Branch ($6.31M)** transactions are high, leading to high maintenance costs.
  - **Recommendation:** Encourage migration to online ($6.08M) and mobile channels.
### Merchant and Credit Card Analysis
- **Merchant Activity:** Spending is concentrated in digital services and travel **(Airbnb, Apple)**, with **Local Retail** lagging behind.
  - **Recommendation:** Expand merchant partnerships with local shops and offer loyalty rewards.
- **Credit Card Usage:** Customers without credit cards are making more payment-type transactions.
  - **Problem:** This indicates credit cards aren't positioned as the preferred payment tool.
  - **Recommendation:** Reposition credit cards as the primary payment tool (e.g., cashback on bills) and target non-card customers.

- **Total Cost: $21.17M**
- **Total Profit: $38.25M**

- **Average Revenue per Staff: $30.46K**
### Key Branch Recommendations

- **Reassess East:** The weakest financial performer, requiring restructuring or support.

- **Complaint Types:** The most frequent types of complaints are Charges Dispute (184), Others (167), Service Delay (159), Technical Issues (148), and Fraud (142).
